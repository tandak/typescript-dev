# Movie Rental
The `returnCustomerRentalStatement` function in `refactoring-task.ts` returns a statement of a customer's movie rental history. The code is valid and correct but has a number of code smells, violates some clean coding practices and is not easy to write unit tests for.

## Task:
Fork and refactor the code however you see fit.
* Add unit test coverage (example: should return the correct frequent renter points)
* Think about the solid principals, which of these principals is the `returnCustomerRentalStatement` function violating.
* The business requires that the `returnCustomerRentalStatement` function always returns the expected output as shown in the unit test `returns the correct rental record`. If that unit test fails the business will be angry!
    * In the future the business would like to add a new `movie code`.
* When completed, raise a PR and explain to the group your reason for refactoring certain aspects of the code. 

**HOW TO RUN TESTS**:
```     
    tsc tests/movie-rental.test.ts
    jest tests/movie-rental.test.js
```

## Advanced:
* Customers and Movies are currently stored in an array. 
    * How else may we want to retrieve this data?
